There is a company with branches in Ireland, the UK, New Zealand and Australia.

The Ireland branch is required to remit the AWS cloud fee through the UK branch. This necessitates the transfer of funds from the Ireland branch to the UK branch, which will then make the payment to AWS on behalf of the Ireland branch.

Previously, the aforementioned branches transacted in USD currency, however the British accounting supervisor has mandated a switch to GBP.

The SA document is primarily utilized for analyzing any potential impact on the billing portal system and proposing a solution to meet the requirements.
